# Texagochi
A tamagochi style discord bot written in c# using discord.net! This was written between 10am and 3:45pm on 8/12/2024 for the UoB CSS botathon, winning first place!

The art assets were made by my partner :3

Due to the nature of this being the first discord bot I have made, plus the 6 hour time limit, there are no commits other than this one.
Furthermore, a lot of design choices and coding practices in this were born out of severe time pressure and not good design principles.
Hence, I would recommend not expanding on the basic functionality without rewriting most of the core structure to make this more scaleable.
